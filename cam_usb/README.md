###This is not working, so you should go back!

The first attempt was to operate the IceCube Upgrade Camera system directly from the PC, using the Arducam USB Shield.

However, the Arducam no longer support image sensor (IMX225)  employed in the ICU camera.

Unless we build new config file with our own, this is not operating.
